# List of Presentations 

1. Agents that graph different incidents 

2. Agent that takes a PDF and allows you to ask "0-hallucinatory" like questions about PDFs.
    - Runs locally, no data sent over the wire
    - Something from the frontend that I found interesting is that they had an API health thing in the sidebar 

3. Crime detector. Link crimes to multiple people based off of priors.

4. A chatbot that takes a problem from the user (related to construction, mechanics, something of that nature) and references a set of standardized SOPs to answer a question related to that particular trade.   
    - Uses voice so that someone doesn't have to pickup and put down the phone 
    - Good use of vector search and agents

<u>Agent Workflow</u>

- Summarize steps to complete
- Summarize safety precautions 
- Need materials 

5. A chrome extension that summarizes documents
    - It was suppose to include vector search, but if it did it, then it seemed pretty unncessary. 

6. A program that will take a set of blueprints and a prompt (that basically asks whether or not these building codes are compliant in x region like San Francisco and Orlando). 
    - Kind of basic 
    - Good usage of vector db (have to sync multiple multiple building codes for different areas) and
    then routes to the correct set of codes for the right area? 

7. A website that ingests tons of company documents and answers questions about them

<u>Agents</u>
